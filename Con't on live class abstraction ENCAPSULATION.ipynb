    "encapsulation is a general concept which you will be able to get in all the programming itself. Basic concept. So it's another way to extend our classes I would say or like it's another way of extending our classes in such a way That it will consist of wrapping of the object. \n",
    "\n",

    "Let's try to understand. So in case of inheritance what we have done? There was a variable inside my parent class, I'm just trying to utilize it. Or there was a function inside my parent classes I was trying to.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "in case of ENCAPSULATION, I will be able to reutilize it but in a little different way, right? So let's suppose I have a requirement. So let's suppose if I have a requirement that, OK, I will create a classes, I will create its variable, but I will not try to show you the actual implementation when you do inheritance, right? So unless and until you are not Careful about your parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's suppose there's another set of requirement that we have to call something from the parent class but have done some implementation or method implementation, some sort of a function implementation. If I have done, I don't want to expose those implementation to you, but still I would like to utilize it, right? So again, we're talking about almost a similar kind of concept, but in a different way, right? So I'm trying to reutilize my parent class code which is already written, but this time I want to show you."

    "So and to implement the sequel, right. So to implement the sequel so we have just installed this MySQL Workbench inside our system. Some of you are still trying to like install this MySQL Workbench. So like I said, it's been used just to hold up data, to update our data, to delete our data, to insert a data, to append our data right to append data again. So when I talk about the data can be available in CSV format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Excel format, Avril format, Jason format, XML format. So you don't know that what kind of data you will be able to get and you can't even say no that no, I will not work with this data because I'm not aware about it, right. You will have to work and this is very much important first step that we always try to take in a data industry whether you are working into a big data or data analytics or media data science anywhere, any of these three data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to work. So yeah we have already like installed MySQL Workbench and we will see like how we can connect. So here the idea is not to write a direct query into MySQL Workbench. The idea over here is we are learning Python first of all. So whatever we are going to do so the software that you have installed which is our SQL Workbench, so we will try to interact with that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like a software with the help of Python, everything we will do with the help of Python even if we have to sort the data, data, data create a connectivity everything. Because when you will go ahead and you will try to create some sort of application right. So you will not be able to like when you will try to get some sort of application. So it's not like you will like actually going for databases, you will log in and\n",
    "\n",
    "So I think it is possible people does that, right. But when we talk about the automation, when we talk about a complete pipeline building for any kind of a process as any kind of a product or services that we need to provide at that point of time. So if I'm using Python as a programming language, so for sure I'll have to use Python programming language and then I'll have to do everything with respect to Python. So now you know that you have a digital notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "And you have a SQL workloads, do you have a two page? So first of all you have to establish communication in between these two things, right? Maybe I'm going to use PyCharm.\n",
    "And yeah, so I'll have to connect Python without SQL. Once I will be able to strategic communication, then I can start like interacting with that databases, I can fetch data, whatever operations I would like to do. So I can try to do all of those operations. So yeah, we'll try to see and everything will try to see with respect to Python because we are learning Python now, any databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try to connect with any languages that is possible because for every database connectors are available, including Python, java.net, whatever you're going to use for everything suppose actually possible then just one time like a task. So we all are going to like, do it, we are going to see it, right? And we all see how to interact and how to build a beautiful small application out of this one so that I will be able to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependencies of keeping our data in my local system, so I will try to dump all of those data. I'll try to interact with my databases all the time as a particular required to like deal with the data set. So I hope this idea is pretty much clear that why we are going to use SQL. Is it clear to everyone or like to still you are in like some robot?\n",
    "\n",
    "Which company provides databases so there are like.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if I talk about Mango, it's a Mango actually, right? So there are like hundreds of databases, so hundreds of different companies. Like if I talk about query table, it's a Google actually. So if I talk about Mango, it's a Mango actually, right? If I talk about like MySQL, Oracle, so it's Oracle. If I'll talk about DB2, it's IBM\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeah. So I can see it's, it's it's like a clear. So database is pretty much important first of all. Now I'll tell you one more fact about these things. So the fact is job wise, right. So if you are going to apply as a data analyst, but if you're going to apply for data analyst position at that point of time, people will be expecting that you know SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know very well write SQL. So they will give you like a small data. They will ask you if you write a SQL query for that, if you are going to like explore for a job in the US market or in a Europe market right outside India over there. Again, SQL part is pretty much important if I'll talk about a nature of job in India, so just for a data analytics job, so SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know very well write SQL. So they will give you like a small data.

    "\n",
    "But if I'll talk about a data scientist job here in India, so here you should know implementation. You should not know like a sequel. They will not ask you like too many questions in SQL. They'll ask you maybe some basic one, right? This is how things works. Job, market different because expectations, roles, responsibilities are different. So they have like defined this criteria. You can say so yes, if you're from US or dope. So it's my sincere advice to all of you.\n",
    "\n",
    "But just try to like try to get a very good knowledge with respect to see. I will share a documentation like I'll share the complete like examples of a SQL. It's a complete like books that we have created for a SQL that will be available inside your dashboard. Then I'll talk about a SQL. So whenever I'll start discussing about SQL those things will be even inside your dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're going for data analytics or data science job, then yeah data into SQL. It will help you out a lot how MySQL is better than Excel. Excel is not a standard way of storing our data. Databases are different, Excel workbook is different, right. So if I have to create some sort of a.\n",
    "\n",
    "me excel sheet with more than two lack of record and try to open up your system. The system will pass, right? Excel is just for like a showcasing some stats or like building some kind of a graph for some meeting purpose or something. But Excel is nowadays not a standard way for that we have BI tool Power BI.\n",
