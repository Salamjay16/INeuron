  {// That we have to call something from the parent but.// In parent, let's suppose if I have done so// Equal to test one and self box test two is equal to test two like right over here and maybe I can try to.
// Not just one.
// IT and self-taught test is equal to test.
// I can try to write over here.
// In it and under score under score self I can try to write maybe just maybe test one, maybe test 2.
// Yeah.
// Right.
// Aspinal maybe? And then I can try to like uh.
// Then I can try to create.
// A test tool I can write.
// OK. So yeah.
// It's just uh two I can try to write over here and maybe same definition I can try to copy and paste.
// First one class, I'll just change the definition.
// So that was my biggest one. In my next class which I'm trying to create and I can write again like a dev over here I'm just going to score. Same thing. I can copy and paste, no need to write it down again. So.
// OK, now I will try to create another classes over here. Let's suppose I'm going to create class like test 1.
// Maybe I can try to overwrite his STR method and here so I can write write like a self and then I can try to do a return and then this is done from my test to class.
// Self-taught and B is equal to B and self dot C is equal to C and.
// Equal to a.
// No. So I'm going to create a class, let's suppose just over here very simple class I can try to create and I can write dev and under score, under score init under score, under score and then if I can try to create a comma B comma. See I can try to create over here self dot a is equal to.
// Let's try to achieve all of these things. So here I can start writing our code. Maybe for encapsulation. Sorry, I won't be able to discuss the database code.
// A concept called as encapsulation, yes. So let's let's try to do it.
// So now let's try to do one thing. So let's try to create some classes. Let's try to create some sort of a function, right? And let's see how I will be able to achieve.
// Still, you should know about it. You want. We are supposed to be about it, yeah.
// Practically have not shown you so like theoretically are you able to get some idea? OK so idea wise this is something called definition is something called an encapsulation. Again don't worry no one will ask you any question on this part like what is like division of encapsulation Interview but.
// Actually where we are trying to hide the implementation.
// Right. You don't know that complementation but you can make use of it. So you you just you take, you take capsules. That's true. But without knowing the implementation of the capsule, take it right. So if because doctor has prescribed you, so if I will tell you that, OK fine. So that is the class and that class is encapsulated but you can use it. You will be able to do this task for that task. So if you will try to create this kind of structure then it is called as a.
// Fine, so I'll take this capsule. So maybe it will like this particular disease on that, but you don't know the actual composition or actual implementation in programming language.
// Alright, don't know what is like, what is the composition of a different different chemicals are there, right. Unless open, even if you will open up, you will just see the powder or paste or something, right. So it's just like we have like what just behave like a container or closed envelope you can say right or container. So you know that.
// If you have to understand, so I think you all are aware about our capsule, right, Tablets, capsules inside a capsule. So you will be able to find out some liquid or maybe some powder sometime like that you will be able to find out, you know that if I'll take this caption. So for sure maybe I'll feel better for this particular disease or that particular disease. But do you even know that what is that inside this capsule?
// Different way right? So I'm trying to reutilize my parent class code which is already written, but this time I don't want to show you that. OK fine, So what was the actual variable name or like what was the actual function name? So maybe I can try to achieve those kind of things inside the OOPS concept with the help of encapsulation. So again in layman.
// But let's suppose there's another set of a requirement that we have. So we have a requirement that we have to call something from the parent. But in parent, let's suppose if I have done some implementation or method implementation, some sort of a function implementation. If I've done, I don't want to expose those implementations to you, but still I would like to utilize it, right? So again, we're talking about almost.
// Care about your parent class that what in all variables, what in all objects were in all functions are available inside your parent classes. You will not use it. You will not be able to use it because you will write it and you will try to call the variable name or you will try to call a function name which was available inside your parent classes. This is what we can do in case of inherit.
// Even in case of encapsulation, I will be able to reutilize it but in a little different way, right? So let's suppose I have a requirement. So if let's suppose if I have a requirement that, OK, I will create a classes, I will create its variable, but I will not try to show you the actual implementation when you do inheritance, right? So unless and until you are not.
// How are you?
// The laws of variable inside my parent class, I'm just trying to utilize it or there was a function inside my parent classes I was trying to.
// What is the meaning of it? Let's try to understand. So in case of inheritance what we have?
// Again, encapsulation is a general concept which you will be able to get in all the programming basic concept. So it's another way to extend our classes I would say or like it's another way of extending classes in such a way that it will consist of wrapping of the object.
me implementation of method, implementation reutilize it. Yeah that. That is that things are achievable with that of inheritance, right? So I will be able to save my time, number of lines of code, my code will be much more modernized. There's a concept called as encapsulation which comes after inheritance for sure. So encapsulation is.
